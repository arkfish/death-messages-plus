# death-messages-plus
Custom death messages plugin for Minecraft. works on Spigot or Bukkit 1.16.x and works with DiscordSRV

Made by arkfish#2294

### Install
Mediafire download: https://www.mediafire.com/file/5qsyy0w4jjgpjul/DeathMessagesPlus.jar/file

Go to your server filesystem in whatever application you choose,
drag the jar into the plugins,
restart or use the command /reload on your server,
use the command /pl on your server and check that the plugin DeathMessagesPlus is there

If installed correctly, you should be able to use custom death messages!

### Side notes/currently known issues
1. Currently the only way to edit the death messages is by changing the DeathMessages.java class itself and then recompiling, I'll later add support for using a configuration file to make it much more easier and streamlined.

2. Arrows and mob death are currently WIP and may not work.

*I have to put this here because somebody is going to PM me on Discord or make an issue on this repository saying one of these things*
